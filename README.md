# King-County-Houses-Data-Analysis

This repository is a data analysis made in Python via Jupyter Notebooks about the Sales of Houses in King County.

This Analysis is made based on the Kaggle dataset (Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction) about House Sales in King County, in the United States. It is my first data analysis on python as i'm diving into Data Science and Machine Learning, i'm currently studying those areas so i can make a model to make a prediction of house prices based on their feature importances.

I intend to show in the analysis Where are the most expensive Houses located at, What features make a house become expensive and What are some good investments to be making based on these features, which houses are 'financially viable'.

I'm open to read any contributions to my analysis and coding, feel free to message me on LinkedIN to suggest any changes or ask for any advice if helps!
